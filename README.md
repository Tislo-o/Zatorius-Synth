This synth features the very basics of digital synthesizers. You can control:
-waveform shape and volume
-unison parameters
-sound envelope(ADSR)

The synth doesn't suffer from aliasing because it doesn't generate "na√Øve" waveforms but load at runtime prebuilt bandlimited ones. 
The latter were generated in order to match each note to a waveform that contains only harmonics below Nyquist frequency.
